# Temperature Alert

Temperature Alert is a small API only application that sends SMS notifications to users when the temperature in their area hits the user's configured alert thresholds.

For example, I keep my windows open at night during the summer to let in the cool night air, and I use Temperature Alert to remind me to close the windows once it gets hot enough outside.

The back-end logic for configuring alerts and delivering notifications is complete, but the API is not.
